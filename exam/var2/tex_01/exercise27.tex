\begin{question}
We investigate quantity of phones sold. We want to check wheter there was an interaction effect of phone model (6 brands are investigated) and number of years passed since it's issue (0, 1 or 2). For each factor we have 3 replicates (the sample is balanced).

Calculate the F-statistic for the interaction effect, given that:

\[
\begin{array}{l|r} 
& \text { Sum of Squares } \\\hline
SS_{ \text{model} }  & 0.419 \\
SS_{ \text{year} }  & 0.404 \\
SS_{ \text{Residuals} }  & 11.488  \\
SS_{ \text{Total} }  & 12.466 \\
\end{array}
\]
\end{question}
