\begin{question}
I have five results of two runners A and B for the 5 km race:

19:52 (A), 19:20 (B), 19:46 (A), 2:43 (B), 1:46 (B).

Calculate Mann-Whitney statistic \(U_A\) that tests the null-hypothesis of equal distributions of time.

(The statistic \(U_A\) should positively depend on the ranks of the runner A).
\end{question}
