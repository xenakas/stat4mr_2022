\begin{question}
We want to check whether students in classes of smaller size have higher grades.

The dummy variable \(small_i\) is the indicator of small class size, \(a_i\) is the normalized student age.

The logit equation is \(\hat{\mathbb{P}}(small_i = 1) = \Lambda(-0.5 + 0.2 a_i)\), where \(\Lambda\) is the logistic function.

What is the propensity score for a student with \(a_i = 3\)?
