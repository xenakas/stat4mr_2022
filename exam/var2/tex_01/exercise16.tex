\begin{question}
Consider three variables: target variable \(y_i\), predictor \(x_i\) and indicator of treatment \(z_i \in \{0,1\}\).

The treatment \(z_i\) was designed to be independent of \(x_i\), but in fact \(x_i = f_i \cdot (1 + 0.03 z_i)\).

We suppose that \(z_i\) are Bernoulli with \(p=0.9\), \(f_i \sim \mathcal{N}(400;16)\) and they are independent.

Find the probability limit
\[
    \mathrm{plim} \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar x)(z_i - \bar z)}{n-1}.    
\]
