\begin{question}
We want to check wheter students in classes of smaller size have higher grades. We have estimated the logistic regression to calculate propenisity scores based on two additional factors \(x_1\) -- normalised average students' age, \(x_2\) -- normalised average students' grade.

We have the following observation from the group with smaller classes:

\(x_1=0.2802563, x_2=0.0036276\)

Which observation from the following subsample will be matched with that observation by propensity score

\[
\begin{array}{rrrrr} 
 \text { Observation number }&  \text { Treatment } &  x_1  &  x_2  & \text { Better grades } \\
\hline 
 \mathbf{1} & 0 & 0.0237504 & -0.5896634 & 1 \\
 \mathbf{2} & 0 & -1.008805 & -0.5676275  & 0 \\
 \mathbf{3} & 0 &  -1.8723263  & -1.000535   & 1
\end{array}
\]

given that the estimated coefficients for the logistic regression for \(p(treatment=1|x_1,x_2)\) are \(\hat{\beta}_0 = 0.993509\), \(\hat{\beta}_1 = 0.3156265\) and \(\hat{\beta}_2 = 0.8399317\)?
\end{question}
