\begin{question}
My target variable is binary and I wish minimal detectable effect equal to 0.04, probability of I-error not greater than 0.01, probability of II-error not greater than \texttt{beta}. The control and experimental group
are of the same size equal to \(n\).

Which minimal value of \(n\) is sufficient in the worst case?
\end{question}
