\begin{question}
Consider we have a sample of 30 observations for Price \(P\), Quantity Sold \(Q\) and the Good Quality \(Z\).
We know that\\
\(\sum{P} = 986.38\),
\(\sum{Q} = 467.45\),
\(\sum{Z} = 1813.22\),
\(\sum{P^2} = 43366.27\),
\(\sum{Q^2} = 7394.64\),
\(\sum{Z^2} = 215734.73\),
\(\sum{PQ} = 15237\),
\(\sum{QZ} = 27601\),
\(\sum{PZ} = 93539\).

Calculate \(r_{PQ} - r_{PQ-Z}\), where \(r_{PQ}\) is Pearson correlation and \(r_{PQ-Z}\) is partial correlation.
\end{question}
