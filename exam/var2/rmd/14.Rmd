```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION
na = sample(2:3, size = 1)
nb = sample(3:4, size = 1)
max_rank = na + sample(1:2, size = 1)

sol = choose(max_rank - 1, na - 1) / choose(na + nb, na)
sol_round = round(sol, digits = 2)
```

Question
========
I have results of two runners A and B: `r na` results for A and `r nb` results
for B. The running time for both runners are continuously distributed and their distribution are equal.

What is the probability that the maximal rank of running times of the runner A will be equal to `r max_rank`?
