```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION
n = sample(1:4, size = 1) * 10
n_lowest = sample(2:4, size = 1)

alpha = sample(1:5, size = 1)
p = alpha / 100 


conclusions = c('correct', 'wrong')
p_correct = round(pbinom(n_lowest - 1, size = n, prob = p), digits = 2)
sols = c(p_correct, 1 - p_correct)

id = sample(1:2, size = 1)

conclusion = conclusions[id]
sol_round = sols[id]
```

Question
========
I have `r n` hypothesis with independent statistics. The null hypothesis for all `r n`
cases is actually true, but I don’t know this.

I calculate all p-values. 
If the `r n_lowest` lowest p-value are simultaneously lower than `r p` I wrongly conclude that not all $H_0$ are true. Otherwise I correctly conclude that all $H_0$ are true.

What is the probability that I will get the `r conclusion` conclusion?

Solution
