Question
========
Vasiliy loves to eat shaurma. He has $`r p`$ local shaurma dealers. Vasiliy bought $`r r`$ shaurmas
from each dealer and measured their weight. He would like to test the hypothesis that mean weight is the
same for all dealers.

Total sum of squares is $`r tss`$, between sum of squares is $`r bss`$
Calculate the F -statistic to test the hypothesis.
