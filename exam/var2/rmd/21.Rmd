```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION
n = sample(1:4, size = 1) * 100
alpha = sample(1:5, size = 1)
p = alpha / 100 

conclusion = sample(c('correct', 'wrong'), size = 1)


sol_round = n * p * (1 - p)
```

Question
========
I do $`r n`$ independent tests at significance level `r alpha`\%. 
The null hypothesis for all $`r n`$
tests is actually true, but I don’t know this.

Let $N$ be the number of my `r conclusion` conclusions. 

What is the variance of $N$?

Solution
