```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION
a = sample(1:10, size = 1)
b = sample(1:10, size = 1)

sol = sum(c(max(a,a),max(a,b),max(b,a),max(b,b))*1/4)
sol_round = round(sol, digits = 2)

```

Question
========
Consider a sample of two observations: $\{x_1,x_2\} = \{`r a`, `r b`\}$. Find the expected value of bootstrapped sample maximum $E(\max{x^*})$ if bootstrap sample size is 2.
