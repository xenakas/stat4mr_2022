```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION
mde = sample(1:5, size = 1) / 100
beta = sample(1:3, size = 1) / 10
alpha = sample(1:5, size = 1) / 100

n = (qnorm(1 - alpha/2) + qnorm(1 - beta))^2 / 2 / mde^2
sol_round = round(n, digits = 0)
```

Question
========
My target variable is binary and I wish minimal detectable effect equal to `r mde`, probability of I-error not greater than `r alpha`, probability of II-error not greater than ` beta`. The control and experimental group
are of the same size equal to $n$.

Which minimal value of $n$ is sufficient in the worst case?

Solution
