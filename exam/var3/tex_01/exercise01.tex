\begin{question}
Consider we have a sample of 30 observations for Price \(P\), Quantity Sold \(Q\) and the Good Quality \(Z\).
We know that\\
\(\sum{P} = 996.66\),
\(\sum{Q} = 482.12\),
\(\sum{Z} = 1843.54\),
\(\sum{P^2} = 46350.76\),
\(\sum{Q^2} = 7931.29\),
\(\sum{Z^2} = 231290.14\),
\(\sum{PQ} = 16264\),
\(\sum{QZ} = 29880\),
\(\sum{PZ} = 100485\).

Calculate \(r_{PQ} - r_{PQ-Z}\), where \(r_{PQ}\) is Pearson correlation and \(r_{PQ-Z}\) is partial correlation.
\end{question}
