\begin{question}
Winnie-the-Pooh has obtained the point estimate \(\hat\theta = 2\)
with standard error \(se(\hat\theta)= 0.7\).

Winnie-the-Pooh does not remember the distribution of t-statistic,
so he uses t-bootstrap.
He calculates 10000 bootstrap samples, hence 10000 t-statistics \(t^*_j\) and
two quantiles of the vector \(t^*\).

Here they are: \(q_{0.025}(t^*) = -2.3\), \(q_{0.975}(t^*)= 2.5\).

What is the left border of 95\% bootstrap CI?

Provide the answer with 2 decimal digits.
