\begin{question}
I have five results of two runners A and B for the 5 km race:

20:26 (A), 19:53 (A), 20:59 (B), 20:28 (B), 20:56 (B), 19:29 (B), 19:48 (A).

Calculate Mann-Whitney statistic \(U_A\) that tests the null-hypothesis of equal distributions of time.

(The statistic \(U_A\) should positively depend on the ranks of the runner A).
\end{question}
