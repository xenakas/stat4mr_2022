\begin{question}
Consider three variables: target variable \(y_i\), predictior \(x_i\) and indicator of treatment \(z_i \in \{0,1\}\).
The treatment \(z_i\) was assigned independently of \(x_i\), total \(n=400\).

The sample covariance matrix \(C\) is provided.
The order of variables is \(y\), \(x\) and \(z\).
For example the sample covariance of \(x\) and \(z\) is 0.27.

\[
C = \begin{pmatrix}
        7.7 & 2.93 & 0.78 \\
        2.93 & 1.32 & 0.27 \\
        0.78 & 0.27 & 0.25 \\
\end{pmatrix}    
\]

Consider CUPED with first regression given by \(\hat y_i = \hat\alpha_1 + \hat\alpha_2 x_i\) with residuals \(r_i = y_i - \hat y_i\).

What is the sample covariance of \(r\) and \(z\)?
