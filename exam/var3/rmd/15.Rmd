```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION
na = sample(2:3, size = 1)
nb = sample(3:4, size = 1)

sol_round = na * nb / 2
```

Question
========
I have results of two runners A and B: `r na` results for A and `r nb` results
for B. The running times for both runners are continuously distributed.

Consider the Mann-Whitney test statistic $U_a$ that positively depends on the 
rank sum for the runner A. 

Find the expected value $\mathbb{E}(A)$ under the null-hypothesis of equal running 
time distributions.
