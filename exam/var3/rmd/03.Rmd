```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION
vx = sample(1:4, size = 1)^2
vy = sample(1:4, size = 1)^2
alpha = sample(1:9, size = 1) / 10



sol_round = round(alpha * sqrt(vy / vx), digits = 2)
```

Question
========
The variables $X$ and $Y$ are jointly normal with zero means, $\mathrm{Var}(X) = `r vx`$, 
$\mathrm{Var}(Y) = `r vy`$.

We know that $X -`r alpha` Y$ is not correlated with $Y$. 

What is the correlation between $X$ and $Y$?

Solution
