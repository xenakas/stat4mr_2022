```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION
library(knitr)
data = data.frame(id = 1:8, y = round(rnorm(8, 20, 4), 0), z = c(0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1),
                  x = c(5, 11, 19, 37, 48, 12, 4, 17))

to_match = sample(1:8, size = 1)
answers = c(7, 6, 8, 5, 4, 2, 1, 3)
sol_round = answers[to_match]
```

Question
========
Vasiliy uses knn algorithm with 1 neighbor to match observations. 
Here $z$ is treatment indicator, $x$ is predictor and $y$ is target variable.

`r kable(data)`

Which individual will be matched with individual number `r to_match`?
