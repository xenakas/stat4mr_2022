\begin{question}
We want to check wheter students in classes of smaller size have higher grades. We have estimated the logistic regression to calculate propenisity scores based on two additional factors \(x_1\) -- normalised average students' age, \(x_2\) -- normalised average students' grade.

We have the following observation from the group with smaller classes:

\(x_1=-1.5566141, x_2=-0.057464\)

Which observation from the following subsample will be matched with that observation by propensity score

\[
\begin{array}{rrrrr} 
 \text { Observation number }&  \text { Treatment } &  x_1  &  x_2  & \text { Better grades } \\
\hline 
 \mathbf{1} & 0 & 1.8190671 & -2.0334748 & 1 \\
 \mathbf{2} & 0 & 0.7966492 & -0.5216816  & 0 \\
 \mathbf{3} & 0 &  1.3666589  & 0.4780969   & 1
\end{array}
\]

given that the estimated coefficients for the logistic regression for \(p(treatment=1|x_1,x_2)\) are \(\hat{\beta}_0 = 0.9690616\), \(\hat{\beta}_1 = 0.2789394\) and \(\hat{\beta}_2 = 0.706707\)?
\end{question}
