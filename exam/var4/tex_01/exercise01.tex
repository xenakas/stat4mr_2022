\begin{question}
Consider we have a sample of 30 observations for Price \(P\), Quantity Sold \(Q\) and the Good Quality \(Z\).
We know that\\
\(\sum{P} = 952.26\),
\(\sum{Q} = 494.83\),
\(\sum{Z} = 1674.34\),
\(\sum{P^2} = 38745.6\),
\(\sum{Q^2} = 8413.3\),
\(\sum{Z^2} = 168963.15\),
\(\sum{PQ} = 15883\),
\(\sum{QZ} = 27476\),
\(\sum{PZ} = 78114\).

Calculate \(r_{PQ} - r_{PQ-Z}\), where \(r_{PQ}\) is Pearson correlation and \(r_{PQ-Z}\) is partial correlation.
\end{question}
