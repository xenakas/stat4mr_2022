\begin{question}
I have five results of two runners A and B for the 5 km race:

17:37 (B), 13:25 (B), 11:24 (A), 1:52 (A), 7:13 (B), 7:53 (A).

Calculate Mann-Whitney statistic \(U_A\) that tests the null-hypothesis of equal distributions of time.

(The statistic \(U_A\) should positively depend on the ranks of the runner A).
\end{question}
