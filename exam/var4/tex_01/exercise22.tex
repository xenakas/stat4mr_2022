\begin{question}
I have 10 hypothesis with independent statistics. The null hypothesis for all 10
cases is actually true, but I don't know this.

I calculate all p-values.
If the 2 lowest p-value are simultaneously lower than 0.03 I wrongly conclude that not all \(H_0\) are true. Otherwise I correctly conclude that all \(H_0\) are true.

What is the probability that I will get the wrong conclusion?
\end{question}
