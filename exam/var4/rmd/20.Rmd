```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION
const = -sample(1:6, size = 1)/10
a = sample(1:3, size = 1) 

sol = plogis(const + 0.2 * a)
sol_round = round(sol, digits = 2)
```

Question
========
We want to check whether students in classes of smaller size have higher grades.

The dummy variable $small_i$ is the indicator of small class size, $a_i$ is the normalized student age.


The logit equation is $\hat{\mathbb{P}}(small_i = 1) = \Lambda(`r const` + 0.2 a_i)$, where $\Lambda$ is the logistic function.

What is the propensity score for a student with $a_i = `r a`$?
