Question
========
Consider three variables: target variable $y_i$, predictior $x_i$ and indicator of treatment $z_i \in \{0,1\}$.
The treatment $z_i$ was assigned independently of $x_i$, total $n=`r n`$. 

The sample covariance matrix $C$ is provided. 
The order of variables is $y$, $x$ and $z$. 
For example the sample covariance of $x$ and $z$ is `r C[2,3]`.

$$
C = \begin{pmatrix}
        `r C[1,1]` & `r C[1,2]` & `r C[1,3]` \\
        `r C[2,1]` & `r C[2,2]` & `r C[2,3]` \\
        `r C[3,1]` & `r C[3,2]` & `r C[3,3]` \\
\end{pmatrix}    
$$
    
Consider CUPED with first regression given by $\hat y_i = \hat\alpha_1 + \hat\alpha_2 x_i$ with residuals $r_i = y_i - \hat y_i$.

What is the sample covariance of $r$ and $z$?
