## DATA GENERATION
p = sample(1:9, size = 1) / 10
alpha = sample(1:9, size = 1) / 100
sigma2 = sample(2:4, size = 1)^2
mu = sample(2:9, size = 1) * 100

sol = alpha * mu * p * (1-p)

Question
========
Consider three variables: target variable $y_i$, predictor $x_i$ and indicator of treatment $z_i \in \{0,1\}$.

The treatment $z_i$ was designed to be independent of $x_i$, but in fact $x_i = f_i \cdot (1 + `r alpha` z_i)$.

We suppose that $z_i$ are Bernoulli with $p=`r p`$, $f_i \sim \mathcal{N}(`r mu`;`r sigma2`)$ and they are independent.

Find the probability limit 
$$
    \mathrm{plim} \frac{\sum (x_i - \bar x)(z_i - \bar z)}{n-1}.    
$$
