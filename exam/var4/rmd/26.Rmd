```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION
k = sample(2:5, size = 1)
green_hat = 3 / ( 5 + 5 * k)
yellow_hat = k * green_hat
red_hat = 1 - green_hat - yellow_hat

colors = c('red', 'yellow', 'green')
answers = c(red_hat, yellow_hat, green_hat)
id = sample(1:3, size = 1)
color = colors[id]

sol_round = round(answers[id], digits = 2)
```

Question
========
I ate five M&Ms: red, green, green, red and yellow. 
Only these three colors are possible. 
I assume that $p_{yellow}=`r k` p_{green}$.

What is the estimated probability of `r color` color?

Solution
