```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION
hat_theta = sample(2:9, size = 1)
se_hat_theta = sample(2:9, size = 1) / 10
left_q = -2 - sample(2:9, size = 1) / 10
right_q = 2 + sample(2:9, size = 1) / 10
sol_round = hat_theta - right_q * se_hat_theta
```

Question
========
Winnie-the-Pooh has obtained the point estimate $\hat\theta = `r hat_theta`$ 
with standard error $se(\hat\theta)= `r se_hat_theta`$.

Winnie-the-Pooh does not remember the distribution of t-statistic, 
so he uses t-bootstrap. 
He calculates 10000 bootstrap samples, hence 10000 t-statistics $t^*_j$ and 
two quantiles of the vector $t^*$. 

Here they are: $q_{0.025}(t^*) = `r left_q`$, $q_{0.975}(t^*)= `r right_q`$.

What is the left border of 95\% bootstrap CI?

Provide the answer with 2 decimal digits.
