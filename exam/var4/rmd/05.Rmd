Question
========
You have a sample $X_1, \dots, X_{300}$ with $\overline{X}= `r round(mean(p),3)`$, $\widehat{Var}{X} =  `r round(var(p),3)`$. 

Quantiles of bootstrap distribution of sample mean are given in a table below. 

$$
\begin{array}{c|c|c|c}
5 \% & 10 \% & 90 \% & 95 \% \\
\hline
`r round(quantile(x_mean_star,0.05),3)` & `r round(quantile(x_mean_star,0.1),3)` & `r round(quantile(x_mean_star,0.9),3)` & `r round(quantile(x_mean_star,0.95),3)`
\end{array}
$$


Find the upper bound for 90\%  confidence interval for $\overline{X}-\mu$.
