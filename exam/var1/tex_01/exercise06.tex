\begin{question}
I have five results of two runners A and B for the 5 km race:

16:49 (B), 21:17 (A), 18:30 (B), 6:18 (B), 20:16 (A), 15:39 (B).

Calculate Mann-Whitney statistic \(U_A\) that tests the null-hypothesis of equal distributions of time.

(The statistic \(U_A\) should positively depend on the ranks of the runner A).
\end{question}
