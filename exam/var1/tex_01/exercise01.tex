\begin{question}
Consider we have a sample of 30 observations for Price \(P\), Quantity Sold \(Q\) and the Good Quality \(Z\).
We know that\\
\(\sum{P} = 1130.25\),
\(\sum{Q} = 461.53\),
\(\sum{Z} = 2293.51\),
\(\sum{P^2} = 53041.8\),
\(\sum{Q^2} = 7214.38\),
\(\sum{Z^2} = 269690.62\),
\(\sum{PQ} = 17586\),
\(\sum{QZ} = 35577\),
\(\sum{PZ} = 117571\).

Calculate \(r_{PQ} - r_{PQ-Z}\), where \(r_{PQ}\) is Pearson correlation and \(r_{PQ-Z}\) is partial correlation.
\end{question}
