\begin{question}
I have results of two runners A and B: 3 results for A and 4 results
for B. The running times for both runners are continuously distributed.

Consider the Mann-Whitney test statistic \(U_a\) that positively depends on the
rank sum for the runner A.

Find the expected value \(\mathbb{E}(A)\) under the null-hypothesis of equal running
time distributions.
\end{question}
