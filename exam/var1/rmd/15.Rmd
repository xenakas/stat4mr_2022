Question
========
Indiana Jones has just completed agglomerative clustering of four points:
$(`r x[1]`, `r y[1]`)$, $(`r x[2]`, `r y[2]`)$, $(`r x[3]`, `r y[3]`)$ and
$(`r x[4]`, `r y[4]`)$.

The distance between points is Euclidean, the distance between two clusters is the minimal distance between members of these clusters. 

Using hierarchical clustering he splits his points into two clusters. 
Calculate the distance between these clusters. 

Provide the answer with 2 decimal digits.
