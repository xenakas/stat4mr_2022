## DATA GENERATION

n = sample(1:5, size = 1) * 100 / 2
j = sample(3:7, size = 1)
g = 3

e1 = round(runif(1, 0.7, 3), 2) /20
e2 = round(runif(1, 1, 4), 2) /20


lam = (1/(1+e1)) *(1/(1+e2))

chi = -(n-(j+g)/2-1) * log(lam)
sol_round = round(1 - pchisq(chi, j * (g - 1)), 2)

Question
========

Suppose we conduct LDA analysis to determine number of visits to "Hilton Hotel" during the season (1, 2 or 3 times) based on $`r j`$ explanotary variables.

There are $`r n`$ observations. 

The eigenvalues for discriminant functions are $\gamma_1=`r e1`$ and $\gamma_2=`r e2`$.
Test whether the groups are significantly different from each other. 

Provide the p-value for the corresponding test rounded up to 2 decimal digits as the answer.

Solution
========
