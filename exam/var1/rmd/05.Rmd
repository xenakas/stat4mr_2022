```{r data generation, echo = FALSE, results = 'hide'}
## DATA GENERATION
n = sample(10:20, size = 1) * 10
na = sample(1:3, size = 1) * 10 
nb = sample(1:5, size = 1) * 10 
nc = n - na - nb

pa = na / n
pb = nb / n
pc = nc / n

lnL_ur = na * log(pa) + nb * log(pb) + nc * log(pc)
lnL_r = na * log(1/3) + nb * log(1/3) + nc * log(1/3)

LR = 2 * (lnL_ur - lnL_r)

sol_round = round(LR, digits = 2)
```

Question
========
Vasiliy loves plov. During last `r n` days he had eaten `r na` plovs with lamb, `r nb` plovs with beef
and `r nc` plovs with chicken. 

Calculate the likelihood ratio statistic to test the null hypothesis that all types of plov have the same probability. 

Provide the answer with 2 decimal digits.
