Question
========

We have the following data: 

$y$ — explained binary variable that equals to 1 if a person has bought popcorn at the cinema,

$x$ — person's income in thousand rub with the average of $`r x_avg`$,

$gender$ — binary variable, that equals to 1 for men, 0 for women,

$age$ — person's age   with the average of  $`r age_avg`$.

After estimating a logit regression we get
$$
\widehat{P}(y_i=1) = \Lambda(`r const` + `r x` \cdot x_i + `r gender` \cdot gender_i + `r age` \cdot age_i).
$$

Calculate the absolute difference of probability of buying popcorn for males and females with average age and income.

Provide the absolute value rounded  up to 2 decimal digits as the answer.
