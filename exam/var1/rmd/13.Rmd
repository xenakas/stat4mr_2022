Question
========
Consider 4 points: $(`r x[1]`, `r y[1]`)$, $(`r x[2]`, `r y[2]`)$, $(`r x[3]`, `r y[3]`)$ and
$(`r x[4]`, `r y[4]`)$. Elon Musk applies k-means to find two clusters in these points. 

The distance is Euclidean, initial cluster centers are $c_1= (`r x[1]`, `r y[1]`)$ and $c_2 = (`r x[2]`, `r y[2]`)$.

Calculate the center of the second cluster after infinitely many iterations. 

Provide the ordinate of the second cluster as the answer with 2 decimal digits.
