The `statsmodels` package by default computes the standard errors assuming that outcomes are **independent** across observations. This assumption is unlikely to be true in this setting where we observe individuals over time and we are trying to exploit this information. Clustering allows for **correlation** of the outcome variable within clusters. In our case, it makes sense (even without knowing the data generating process) to cluster the standard errors at the individual levels, allowing the outcome to be correlated over time for an individual $i$."
