    "When analyzing causal relationships, it is very hard to understand which variables to **condition the analysis on**, i.e. how to \"split\" the data so that we are **comparing apples to apples**. For example, if you want to understand the effect of having a tablet in class on studenta' performance, it makes sense to compare schools where students have similar socio-economic backgrounds. Otherwise, the risk is that only wealthier students can afford a tablet and, without controlling for it, we might attribute the effect to tablets instead of the socio-economic background.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the treatment of interest comes from a proper **randomized experiment**, we do not need to worry about conditioning on other variables. If tablets are distributed randomly across schools, and we have enough schools in the experiment, we do not have to worry about the socio-economic background of students. The only advantage of conditioning the analysis on some so-called \"control variable\" could be an increase in power. However, this is a different story.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this post, we are going to have a brief introduction to Directed Acyclic Graphs and how they can be useful to select variables to condition a causal analysis on. Not only DAGs provide visual intuition on which variables we need to *include* in the analysis, but also on which variables we should *not include*, and why."

    "In this post, we have seen how to use Directed Acyclic Graphs to select control variables in a causal analysis. DAGs are very helpful tools since they provide an intuitive graphical representation of causal relationships between random variables. Contrary to common intuition that \"the more information the better\", sometimes including extra variables might bias the analysis, preventing a causal interpretation of the results. In particular, we must pay attention not to include *colliders* that open *spurious* paths that would otherwise be closed."
